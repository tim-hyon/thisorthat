				<h1>THIS OR THAT QUESTION APP</h1>
				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

				<p>This or That Question App is a platform that provides an entertaining way to ask and answer questions in a public/ social network environment.  It provides users access to location specific content and the ability to connect with other users in real-time.</p>

				<p>This Privacy Policy describes how and when Day collects, uses and shares your information when you use our Services.  Day receives your information through our websites, SMS, email notifications, and applications (the "Services" or "App").  When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.  Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize Day to use your information in the United States and any other country where Day operates.</p>

				<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at __________________</p>


				<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

				<p>Information Collected Upon Registration: When you create or reconfigure a Day account, you provide some personal information, such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this information may be listed publicly on our Services, including on your profile page. If you create your Day account by connecting through another service, we may use public information from that connected account to help complete your Day profile.  You may update or modify your profile information and contact information at any time.</p>

				<p>Additional Information: You may provide us with profile information to make public, such as your location, or a photo.  You may provide information to customize your account, such as a cell phone number for the delivery of notifications.  We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services or to market to you.  You may use your account settings to unsubscribe from notifications from Day.  You may also unsubscribe by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on our Services.  We may use your contact information to help others find your Day account. If applicable, your privacy settings control whether others can find you by your email address or cell phone number.  You may choose to upload your address book so that we can help you find Day users you know.  If you email us, we may keep your message, email address and contact information to respond to your request.  Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.</p>

				<p>Other Public Information: Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with other users.  This information includes the messages and comments you post, photos you upload and the metadata associated with those posts and photos, such as when you posted, as well as additional information that result from your use of the Services.</p>

				<p>Location Information: Our Services may estimate and display your location in your Day profile.  You may also tell us your location when you enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information.  We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, and to improve and customize the Services.  For example, we might provide more relevant and location specific content about local events, interesting locations, ads, deals, or offers.</p>

				<p>Cookies: We may use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services.  A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk to help improve your user experience.  Day may use cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services.  Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies.  You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p>

				<p>Log Data: Our servers automatically record information ("Log Data") created by your use of the Services.  Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information.  We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, or interact with our email notifications.  Day uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them.  If not already done earlier, for example, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.</p>

				<p>Third-Parties: Day uses third-party services to help provide our Services and help us understand the use of our Services.  These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address.  Third-party ad partners may share information with us, like a browser cookie ID or cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure ad quality and tailor ads.  For example, this allows us to display ads about things you may have already shown interest in.  If you prefer, you can turn off tailored ads in your privacy settings so that your account is not matched to information shared by ad partners for tailoring ads.</p>


				<h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

				<p>Your Consent: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your Day account.</p>

				<p>Service Providers: We may engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States and abroad.  We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.</p>

				<p>Law and Harm: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Day's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.</p>

				<p>Business Transfers: In the event that Day is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</p>

				<p>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information.</p>


				<h2>Modifying Your Personal Information</h2>
				<p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access or modify the personal information you provided to us and associated with your account.</p>
				<p>You can also permanently delete your Day account.  If you follow the instructions in account settings, your account will be deactivated and then deleted. When your account is deactivated, it is not viewable on the Day application.</p>


				<h2>Our Policy Towards Children</h2>
				<p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 13.  If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us at hridaykemburu@thisorthatapp.me. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.  If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.</p>


				<h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
				<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at http://thisorthatapp.me/privacy. If we make a change to this Policy that, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you via the email address associated with your account.  By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

				<p>Effective: March 4, 2015</p>
